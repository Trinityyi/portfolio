I am the creator of **Can My Dog Eat**, a simple website where you can look up information for over 100 types of food in regards to feeding them to your dog. Most common food types are included along with a breakdown of what, why and how to feed them to your dog. The app is built with React and TailwindCSS and is designed to be fully responsive on all platforms.

I am the co-creator of **boardeaux**, a currently in-development productivity application that lets you add, track and organize notes not unlike Trello and other available web apps. The application is built with React and employs browser technologies to provide a secure and seamless experience between sessions, storing user data completely on the client-side. This allows users to have full control of their data, without the need for a server-side storage solution.

During the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, I developed **COVID-19-Greece**, a Python-generated website for visualizing the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) data for Greece. The application is built with Flash and Google Charts, while it draws data from [COVID-19 Data Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) by Johns Hopkins University via the use of git submodules and GitHub Actions to refresh the chart data daily.
